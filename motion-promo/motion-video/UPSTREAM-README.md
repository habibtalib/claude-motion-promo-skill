# motion-video

An agent skill that turns a short brief into a directed motion-graphics MP4.

Your AI agent researches only what you did not supply and writes a direction. It builds the scenes in HTML, CSS and SVG, and renders them frame-exact with headless Chromium and ffmpeg. Sound effects are synthesized from the motion on screen, so every hit lands on its frame.

## What you can make

| Video                 | Example request                                                              |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Product teaser        | "A 30-second teaser for the app in this repo."                               |
| Feature explainer     | "Explain how our invoice scanner works, 45 seconds, from these screenshots." |
| App demo or tutorial  | "A walkthrough of the sign-up flow, portrait, for Instagram."                |
| Lesson or explainer   | "A 60-second video that explains how DNS resolves a domain."                 |
| Data story            | "Turn these quarterly numbers into a short animated story."                  |
| Event or announcement | "Announce our meetup on 12 March, with the venue photo."                     |
| Music-synced edit     | "Cut these screenshots to this track, on the beat."                          |
| Kinetic typography    | "Our manifesto as kinetic type, no UI."                                      |

Give it whatever you have: a repo, a URL, screenshots, a logo, footage, music, a voiceover. From a one-line brief, the agent researches the subject and puts only real facts on screen.

## Install

Ask your AI agent:

> Install the motion-video skill from https://github.com/farhan-syah/motion-video-skill for yourself, then run its setup.

**For the agent doing the install:**

1. **Clone:** `git clone https://github.com/farhan-syah/motion-video-skill <skills-folder>/motion-video`. Use the folder your tool loads skills from, else any folder the user picks.
2. **Install:** `cd <skills-folder>/motion-video/scripts && bun install`, or `npm install` without Bun.
3. **Check:** run `node scripts/video.mjs doctor` in the user's folder. Fix what it marks missing, or tell the user.
4. **Speech (optional):** the first `speak` or `transcribe` installs the local speech runtime and downloads its models once. `"models"` in `~/.config/motion-video/config.json` points at a folder the user keeps.
5. **Report** the installed version and anything `doctor` found missing.

**Manual install:** `git clone https://github.com/farhan-syah/motion-video-skill motion-video` into your agent's skills folder, then `cd motion-video/scripts && bun install`. An agent without a skills feature must read `motion-video/SKILL.md` before it makes a video.

**Requirements:**

- **Bun** (https://bun.sh) installs dependencies and fetches fonts. npm works as a fallback.
- **Node.js 20+.**
- **ffmpeg and ffprobe** on `PATH`.
- **Chrome or Chromium,** found automatically. Otherwise run `bunx playwright install chromium-headless-shell` in `scripts/`.
- **GPU (optional):** Chromium draws on any available GPU, and an NVIDIA GPU also encodes with NVENC. Otherwise rendering runs on the CPU.

## Versions and updates

- **Installed version:** `node scripts/video.mjs version`, also printed by `doctor`. `CHANGELOG.md` lists what each version adds.
- **When to check:** when the user asks, or when `doctor` says one is due. It is due when none ran yet, or the last is over 30 days old. The skill never uses the network for this unasked.
- **Check:** `node scripts/video.mjs update --check` shows what a newer version adds.
- **Update:** with the user's consent, `node scripts/video.mjs update` pulls the latest version and reinstalls the dependencies. On local edits or a branch other than `main`, it changes nothing and says what to do.
- **Not a git clone:** replace the folder with a fresh clone, then run the install step again.

## Use

Ask for a video in plain words. The agent follows `SKILL.md`. It checks your machine and files, gathers facts, and asks a few questions with defaults (say "one-shot" to skip them). Then it writes `direction.md`, builds one HTML file per scene, lints each scene, and renders.

The kit holds UI parts, 3D props, atmospheres, maps from Natural Earth data, 1854 icons and any Fontsource font. Scenes can also use canvas, WebGL (three.js), GSAP, Lottie and footage.

Output: `out/video.mp4` (master) and `out/video-compressed.mp4`, about a quarter the size, for chat apps and social uploads.

**Sound:** music only when you supply it. Otherwise each motion gets a synthesized sound effect.

**Voiceover:** your recording, a TTS file, subtitles or a script (plain or timed per line), used as given. A local Whisper model times every word, so captions and scenes follow the speech. For a script without a recording, the agent picks a local text-to-speech engine that fits your language and machine:

| Engine                  | Languages                                               | Machine                          |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Kokoro (default)        | English                                                 | Any, CPU only included           |
| VoxCPM2                 | 30, with described or cloned voices                     | NVIDIA GPU with 8 GB, and `uv`   |
| Any Hugging Face model  | The model's, such as MMS-TTS in 1,100+ (non-commercial) | Any, CPU only included, and `uv` |
| Any TTS you already use | The tool's                                              | Wherever it runs                 |

`node scripts/video.mjs doctor` shows which of these your machine runs. Languages, hardware and adding your own voice or model: `references/tts.md`.

## CLI

The agent runs `node scripts/video.mjs <command>` from the project folder. You can run it too. Every command, `video.json` field and environment variable: `references/cli.md`.
